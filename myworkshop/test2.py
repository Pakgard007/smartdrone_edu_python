# Tello commands respond with an OK when sucessful. This means Tello recognizes
# the command, but the instruction hasn't completed. OK is Tello saying "I got
# the message" but not necessarily saying "I completed the command"
# This means we need to calculate how long the spin will take before we execute the next command.
# Based on our tests a single 360 rotation takes 7 seconds. We'll use this in our spin function to delay
# before the next command. Your rotation time may vary. You can calculate this by
# sending a "cw 360" or "ccw 360" command and measuring the rotation time.

# 7 seconds per rotation
rotationTime = 7

# Spin right or left X number of times

  # One rotation is 360 degrees
  oneRotation = 360
